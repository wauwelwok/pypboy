Pipboy TV version
Based on ZapWizard's Pypboy

components:
Waveshare 4' display
Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
2 Rotary Switches

Works with keyboard and GPIO
Navigation:
Main menu: F1 -> F6, or turn rotary switch menu
sub menu: 1 -> 4, submenus are empty animation
up down for radio / inv, or turn rotary switch sub
+ / - for map rotary switch sub

> Create a config.py file with googlemaps_token = {your token} in the main folder

Still has to be cleaned up, radio doen't work, need to make images/animation for the inv menu.
Also have to work on the online map function, only made offline map work, because I build this pipboy as a cosplay prop.
